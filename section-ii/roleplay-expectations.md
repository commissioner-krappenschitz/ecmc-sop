# Roleplay Expectations

When engaging in roleplay as a member of the Eastdale Medical Center, it is essential to maintain a realistic and immersive environment. Members are expected to:

* _**Communicate Professionally:**_ Use appropriate language, tone, and terminology while interacting with patients, colleagues, and other players involved in roleplay scenarios.
* _**Provide Accurate Medical Assistance:**_ Apply appropriate medical knowledge and techniques to assess and treat patients based on their condition, following realistic protocols.
* _**Follow Chain of Command:**_ Respect the department's rank structure and follow the instructions of higher-ranking members during roleplay situations.

The Hospital Administration requires all department members to maintain realistic roleplay while on-duty. Unrealistic roleplay, metagaming or any 'fail-roleplay' that includes any of the following actions:&#x20;

* Use of any vehicles, items or weapons in an unreasonable manner
* Fighting or displaying acts of aggression towards other members of the department or civilians
* Committing actions outside of paramedic/hospital operating procedures is **not** permitted.

Members must use appropriate language while on duty. This includes slurs around race, sexuality, and religion.
