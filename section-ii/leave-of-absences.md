# Leave of Absences

In the event that a member requires a leave of absence, they must submit a formal request to the department leadership or to any hospital supervisors. The request should include the reason for the absence, the expected duration, and any relevant supporting documentation if applicable. Members are encouraged to give advance notice whenever possible to facilitate proper scheduling and ensure continuity of service.

You may submit your Leave of Absence Letter to any Hospital Administrator/Supervisor through their emails (Discord, direct message).
