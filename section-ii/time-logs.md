# Time Logs

To maintain accurate records and monitor member activity, the Eastdale Medical Center requires all members to maintain detailed time logs. These logs should include the date, time in, time out, and a brief summary of activities performed during each shift or engagement. Time logs should be submitted to the designated department personnel on a regular basis as per the department's guidelines.
