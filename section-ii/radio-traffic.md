# Radio Traffic

When using your radio, you are to remain professional on it at all times. You may not use it for person-to-person conversations, you may request a frequency-change for important conversations. When in apparatuses, only the person in the officer's seat shall talk over radio when necessary, unless there is important radio traffic from another individual.
