# Activity Requirements

Active participation is crucial to maintaining an effective and reliable medical department. Members should strive to:

* _**Attend Department Meetings:**_ Regularly participate in department meetings to stay informed about updates, training opportunities, and any changes in procedures or protocols.
* _**Regularly Engage in Roleplay:**_ Participate in roleplay scenarios, emergencies, and other medical events within the Eastdale City server to contribute to the overall immersive experience and provide prompt medical assistance when required.
* _**Maintain Communication:**_ Stay in touch with department leadership and colleagues, keeping them informed about your availability, planned leaves of absence, or any issues that may affect your activity level.

The department/hospital requires members to log at least **twelve (12) hours a month**. If the required amount of hours are not achieved by a member will result in a Department Strike.
