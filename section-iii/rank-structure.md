# Rank Structure

The Eastdale Medical Center follows a hierarchical rank structure to maintain clear lines of authority and responsibilities. For this hospital administration, every rank/position does not mean you will have to work your way up to gain position.&#x20;

If you work as a member of your Paramedic/EMS/EMT team, you will remain under their provision and duties unless you take any program/board exam to work as a license hospital staff/nurse/doctors.

If you work as a member of your nurse staffs, you will remain under their provision and duties unless you take a medical program/board exam to work as one of our hospital doctors.

The rank structure includes the following positions:

* Nurse
* Charge Nurse
* Chief Nurse

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Hospital Physicians/Surgeons:**</mark>

* Intern
* Resident
* Fellow
* Attending
* Department Chief
* Medical Directors
* CEO

Each rank carries specific responsibilities, and promotion to higher ranks is based on experience, training, and demonstrated competence. Members should familiarize themselves with the duties and expectations associated with their respective ranks.
