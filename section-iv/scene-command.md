# Scene Command

During roleplay scenarios, the Scene Command system is implemented to maintain order and coordination. The Scene Command structure consists of the following roles:

* _**Incident Commander (IC):**_ The IC is responsible for overall command, coordination, and decision-making during a scene.
* _**Medical Branch Director (MBD):**_ The MBD oversees medical operations at the scene, ensuring appropriate medical care is provided to patients.
* _**Triage Officer:**_ The Triage Officer assesses and prioritizes patients based on the severity of their injuries or medical conditions.
* _**Treatment Officer**_: The Treatment Officer provides medical treatment and interventions to patients as directed by the Triage Officer.
* _**Transportation Officer:**_ The Transportation Officer coordinates the transportation of patients to appropriate medical facilities.

Members should familiarize themselves with the Scene Command structure and their respective roles to ensure effective communication and collaboration during roleplay scenarios.

_**Scene Command EMS:**_

The paramedic on the apparatus will always be in command on an EMS related call. They will also be known as the ALS provider. An ALS provider can give more medicine than an EMT-B and start an IV on a patient. They will be in-charge of Mass Casualty Incidents (MCI) and direct EMS personnel what to do. This only applies for EMS related calls.
